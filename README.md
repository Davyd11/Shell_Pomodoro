The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The function of this script is to give you the pomodoro timer inside the terminal. Show you don't lose your focus while coding.

## Usage
If is the first time using the script, run:

```make```

This will config the alias in your terminal.

Once you have it configured, just run:

```pomodoro```
