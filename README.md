The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The objective of this script is to run a pomodoro timer inside the terminal, so you don't lose your focus while coding.

## Usage
### If is the first time using the script make sure you have installed python3 and then run:

```make``` or run ```mkdir -p ~/Utils/pomodoro/ && cp -r -n . ~/Utils/pomodoro/```

```alias pomodoro="python3 ~/Utils/pomodoro/pomodoro.py"```

This will config the alias in your terminal.

```pomodoro -h``` to display options

### Erase Files from ~/Utils:
```make delete```
